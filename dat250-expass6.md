## Experiment 1

I didn't encounter any major difficulties when following the tutorials. I had this small hiccup where `curl` didn't work when providing a `?name=foo` parameter, but this was solved by escaping `\?` and `\=`

## Experiment 2

Except for some syntax errors here and there the React experiment went pretty smooth.
